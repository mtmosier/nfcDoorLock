nfcDoorLock
===========

Arduino code for a simple nfc door lock.

Prerequisites
=============

This code uses the Adafruit NFC shield library located at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C.

Installation
============

Open the file in your arduino dev environment, change the NFC tag IDS, and compile/upload it to your board.  I used an Arduino Uno.
